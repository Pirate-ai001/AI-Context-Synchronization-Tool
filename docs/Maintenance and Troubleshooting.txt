# Maintenance and Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for maintaining and troubleshooting the **Context Synchronization Tool**, which integrates Git Diffs and file monitoring to streamline context generation for AI models.

The tool is designed to be adaptable, globally maintainable, and user-friendly, with a focus on minimizing manual intervention and ensuring seamless operation.

## Key Components

1. **Git Diff Relational Context**:

   - Tracks changes in version-controlled files.
   - Dynamically includes related files based on a predefined relational map.

2. **File Monitoring**:

   - Tracks changes to non-version-controlled files in real time.
   - Includes relevant updates to ensure complete context generation.

3. **Unified Context Generator**:

   - Combines outputs from Git Diffs and file monitoring.
   - Produces a single context file for AI model interaction.

4. **Configuration Layer**:

   - Ensures compatibility with various AI models (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT).
   - Facilitates framework-independent integration.

## Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Updating the Relational Map

**Purpose**: Keep the relational map up to date as new dependencies or files are introduced.

#### Steps:

1. Open the `relational_map.json` file in the `Configuration` folder.
2. Add or modify file relationships as needed.
3. Save the changes and test the mapping using the following command:
   ```bash
   pnpm map-relations
   ```

#### Best Practices:

- Regularly review the map during significant project updates.
- Use meaningful patterns to avoid unnecessary inclusions.

### 2. Monitoring System Health

**Purpose**: Ensure the file monitoring system is running smoothly.

#### Steps:

1. Verify that the file watcher is active:
   ```bash
   pnpm monitor-status
   ```
2. Restart the monitoring service if needed:
   ```bash
   pnpm restart-monitor
   ```
3. Check the log files in `Administrative_Actions/Logs` for any errors.

#### Common Issues:

- **Symptom**: File changes are not being detected.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the watcher includes the correct file paths and extensions in its configuration.
- **Symptom**: High resource usage.
  - **Solution**: Optimize the inclusion/exclusion rules in the monitoring script.

### 3. Validating Context Output

**Purpose**: Ensure the generated context file is accurate and within size limits.

#### Steps:

1. Generate the context file manually:
   ```bash
   pnpm sync-context
   ```
2. Open and review the `context-for-claude.txt` file in the `Administrative_Actions/Context_Syncing` folder.
3. Check for missing or redundant data.

#### Best Practices:

- Regularly test the context output after significant changes.
- Use the context size checker tool:
  ```bash
  pnpm check-context-size
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

#### 1. **Relational Files Missing from Context**

- **Cause**: Missing or outdated entries in the relational map.
- **Solution**:
  1. Update the relational map in `relational_map.json`.
  2. Run the mapping verification tool:
     ```bash
     pnpm verify-relations
     ```

#### 2. **File Monitoring Service Fails to Start**

- **Cause**: Incorrect configuration or missing dependencies.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check the monitoring logs for errors.
  2. Reinstall dependencies:
     ```bash
     pnpm install
     ```
  3. Restart the service:
     ```bash
     pnpm restart-monitor
     ```

#### 3. **Context File Exceeds AI Model Limits**

- **Cause**: Excessive data inclusion from Git Diffs or file monitoring.
- **Solution**:
  1. Review the context file for redundant data.
  2. Update inclusion/exclusion rules in the monitoring script.
  3. Use summarization or filtering tools:
     ```bash
     pnpm summarize-context
     ```

#### 4. **Inconsistent Behavior Between AI Models**

- **Cause**: Model-specific configuration mismatches.
- **Solution**:
  1. Review the configuration file in the `Configuration` folder.
  2. Update parameters for the target model (e.g., token limits, formatting).

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Issue**: Some scripts or dependencies might not work as expected on all platforms.
- **Solution**:
  - Use platform-agnostic tools wherever possible.
  - Test scripts on all supported platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

### 2. Scaling for Large Projects

- **Issue**: Relational mapping and file monitoring may slow down with large codebases.
- **Solution**:
  - Optimize mapping rules to avoid unnecessary inclusions.
  - Use chunking for large files to split data into manageable parts.
